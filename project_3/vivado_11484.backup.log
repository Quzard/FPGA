CRITICAL WARNING: [HDL 9-806] Syntax error near "non-printable character with the hex value '0xcf'". [C:/Users/Quzard/OneDrive/FPGA/project_3/project_3.srcs/sources_1/new/vga.v:1]
CRITICAL WARNING: [filemgmt 20-730] Could not find a top module in the fileset sources_1.
Resolution: With the gui up, review the source files in the Sources window. Use Add Sources to add any needed sources. If the files are disabled, enable them. You can also select the file and choose Set Used In from the pop-up menu. Review if they are being used at the proper points of the flow.
ERROR: [Common 17-53] User Exception: Top module not set for synthesis run
Ensure that a valid value is provided for 'top'. The current value for 'top' can be changed using the 'Top Module Name' field under 'Project Settings', or using the 'set_property top' Tcl command
